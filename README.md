Project: DriverPass System Analysis and Design

1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was designed for a client who wanted to modernize the way students prepare for their driver’s license exams. The client requested a web-based system that would allow students to schedule driving lessons, take online practice tests, and track their progress. The system also needed to give administrators and instructors the ability to manage lessons, monitor student performance, and update course materials. The main goal was to create a secure, reliable, and easy-to-use platform that connects students, instructors, and administrators.

2. What did you do particularly well?

I believe I did particularly well in staying organized throughout the project and clearly understanding the client’s requirements. I would like to showcase my work on the UML use case design because it was one of the most interesting parts of the process. Putting everything “on paper” helped me visualize how each actor interacted with the system and better understand their roles. It also showed how multiple users, like students and administrators, contribute to different processes, which gave me a broader view of the entire system.

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve my sequence diagram. My professor gave helpful feedback, mentioning that my updated sequence diagram included the Bank Server and error branches for PIN and funds issues, which added depth to the process. However, it still ended sessions too quickly after a failure, instead of allowing retries or alternative actions. Based on that, I would revise it by including a looping mechanism for retries and clearer paths for recovery, which would make the system more realistic and user-friendly.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

To interpret the user’s needs, I focused on the client interview and identified their main goals: convenience, accessibility, and security. I implemented these needs by designing an online platform where students could easily schedule lessons, make payments, and receive automated confirmations. It’s important to consider user needs because the design must be intuitive and efficient to ensure users can achieve their goals without frustration. A system’s success depends on how well it serves its users.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software, I begin by gathering clear requirements and visualizing how users will interact with the system. I rely heavily on UML diagrams, since they help me organize system components and identify potential issues early on. In the future, I plan to keep using UML modeling, Agile methods, and user feedback sessions to improve collaboration and refine the system design over time. These strategies help create software that is structured, user-oriented, and adaptable to changing needs.
